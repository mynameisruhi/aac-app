**Overview**
This project was developed for Adapted Recreations, a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting children and adults with disabilities. Having volunteered with the organization for two years, I recognized a need for a streamlined, accessible digital communication tool for non-verbal individuals or those with speech impairments.
This web application allows users to communicate through a categorized grid of icons and text-to-speech functionality, providing a voice to those who need it most.

**Key Features**
Categorized Vocabulary: Organized sets of words and phrases (e.g., Needs, Emotions, Actions) for quick navigation.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration: Converts selected icons into audible speech to facilitate real-time conversation.
Responsive Design: Fully accessible on tablets and desktop computers, which are commonly used in therapeutic settings.
User Authentication: Secure login for caregivers and users to maintain personalized communication boards.
